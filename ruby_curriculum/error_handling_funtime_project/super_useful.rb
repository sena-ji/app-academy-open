  # App Academy's exception post did not go through a lot of the parts on how to properly write them.
  # found this blog post that I found useful:
  # https://www.honeybadger.io/blog/a-beginner-s-guide-to-exceptions-in-ruby/
  # also this stackoverflow question's answer said that "raise already sets the message so you don't have to pass it to the constructor":

  # but I did it anyways so it's easier to read
